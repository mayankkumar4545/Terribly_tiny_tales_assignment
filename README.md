# Getting Started

Prerequisites
   ** Node.js installed on your machine.


** Installation
    1. Clone the repository:
          git clone https://github.com/mayankkumar4545/terribly_tiny_tales.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
### cd terribly_tiny_tales


3. Install dependencies:
### npm install


4. Start the development server:
### npm start


** The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

   1. Access the user profile page by navigating to http://localhost:3000/profile.

   
   2. Explore the user's profile details and view the displayed posts.


Components

Header
  ** The 'Header' component provides the navigation header for the application.


ProfileDetail
   ** The 'ProfileDetail' component displays detailed information about the user, including a profile picture, follower counts, and user analytics.


PostCard
   ** The 'PostCard' component is responsible for rendering individual post cards. It takes post data as a prop and displays the post title, description, and additional details.


Data Sources
 1. User data is imported from 'user.json'.
 2. Post data is imported from 'posts.json'.



Styling
 ** Styling for the components is implemented using CSS files:

1. 'Header.css'
2. 'ProfileDetail.css'
3. 'PostCard.css'
4. 'ProfilePage.css'


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
